        <div class="about-desc">
          <p>
            Hi there! I‚Äôm Jenny, the founder of Jenny Bean, where every cup is
            crafted with love and a sprinkle of joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for coffee began during my senior year of high school when I
            was staying up late working on college applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a way to stay awake quickly turned into a passion. I
            found myself exploring cafes, tasting different brews, and learning
            everything I could about what makes a truly great cup of coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            That‚Äôs how I started my coffee shop business, Jenny Bean. I wanted
            to create a space where I could share that love for coffee with
            others and bring people joy, comfort, and a sense of connection
            through every cup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you‚Äôre here for your daily caffeine fix or to try something
            new, I hope Jenny Bean makes you feel right at home.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for being here and welcome to the family üíõ</p>
