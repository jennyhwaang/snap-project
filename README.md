# Snapchat Academy 2025 Project

Jenny Bean - Snap Engineering Academy

This project is part of the Snap Engineering Academy application process for 2025. Jenny Bean is a coffee ordering website that allows users to browse a catalog of drinks with detailed information such as name, ingredients, caffeine content, rating, milk options, and type (hot or Iced). The site is designed to simulate a digital café experience, with features that support filtering, searching, and putting drinks to cart to order.
